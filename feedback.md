# Feedback

Awesome job on this project! I left a bunch of comments in your files for where specifically to improve your JS, HTML, and CSS code. I would also make sure to remove files you aren't using -- like `phd-mathematics-international.htm` and move things into folders -- like having your images in an `images` folder. Your app looks great! I would keep working on making it fully responsive so that your quiz would work on phones. I also added in some additional formatting to clean up your readme. Again really great job, I really like the additional logic for the arrows and how you added in slides. Also, your app looks great!
